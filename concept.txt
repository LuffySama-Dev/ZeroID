Hi!!


This is the concept file. In this project we were trying to acheieve the validation of the indian users on the basis of the aadhar number.
The exsting sytem is just not enough because we it's (What's the word >>>> ) Hackable... Anyone can stole your identity, but we are trying to secure it.
And yeah it is wallet less and gasless.

Current concept that we have applied is onchain validation using merkle proof, but turns out it has certain limitations and we don't want it.
So, we are moving from on-chain to offchain but still making sure it is credebilty in onchainness. 

On the D-Day  you will understand what we are trying to acheieve. So, stay tuned and some words from us :

Let's make it Big MINA...
